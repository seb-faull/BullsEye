# BullsEye
A 'shoot-em-up', point and click style game with 7 different modes to play in.

## Project Overview
This is a game that has been built to run in browser and that uses *click* events for gameplay. It can run on mobile, however this is not ideal for optimum use.

## Technologies
BullsEye was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additional libraries include jQuery and the jQuery Easing Plugin. Through DOM manipulation, the entire project runs from within the index.HTML.

## Instructions
The aim of the game is to get as much points as you can by shooting ('clicking') the targets. With each game mode the targets move around the screen at random differently. There are 3 targets in total, each giving you a different set of points. 

Green: 10 points - BIG

Blue: 20 points - MEDIUM

Red: 40 points - SMALL

You have 3 lives. Every time you miss you lose a life.

When Total Lives === 0 - Game Over.

When it is game over, your total score for that game is displayed on the Game Over screen.
